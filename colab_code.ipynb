In  this  study,  serum  levels  of  soluble  L-selectin  and  P-selectin  were \n","determined  in  patients  with  HD  and  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  and  in \n","normal healthy individuals. \n","\n","PATIENTSANDMETHODS \n","\n","The study group consisted of 17 patients (10 NHL, 7 HD; 11 men, 6 women; median \n","age 35 years, range 19–70) and 15 healthy volunteers (11 men, 4 women; median \n","age 49 years, range 36–67). Out of 10 NHL patients, 5 were classified as lowgrade, \n","1  intermediate,  and  4  high-grade  according  to  the  Working  Formulation.  Four \n","patients  out  of  7  with  HD  had  mixed  cellularity,  1  nodular  sclerosis,  and  2 \n","lymphocyte  predominance  type.  Staging  was  performed  according  to  the  Ann \n","Arbor system. In NHL, 2 patients had stage III and 8 patients had stage IV disease, \n","and in HD 1 patient had stage II, 2 stage III, and the remaining 4 stage IV disease. \n","All patients with HD and 3 out of 10 with NHL had B-symptoms. Serum L-selectin \n","and P-selectin levels were determined using a commercially available ELISA kit \n","(Bender  MedSystems,  Vienna,  Austria)  according \n","the  manufacturer’s \n","instructions. Data are presented as mean ± SD.

In  HD,  serum  soluble  L-\n","selectin (1140 ± 498 ng/ml; p = 0.0082) and P-selectin (875 ± 370 ng/ml; p = 0.0002) \n","concentrations were significantly elevated also compared to healthy controls (625 \n","± 159 ng/ml and 178 ± 48 ng/ml for L-selectin and P-selectin, respectively). \n","\n","\fDISCUSSION \n","\n","Disseminating  malignant \n","characteristics, \n","interactions [7, 8]. \n","\n","including  migration  and  extravasation \n","\n","lymphoma  cells  and  lymphocytes  share  several \n","involving  adhesive \n","\n","Adhesion molecules in lymphomas \n","\n","29 \n","\n","Table 1. \n","Serum soluble P-selectin and L-selectin levels in the study group \n","\n","Patients \n","\n","P-selectin (ng/ml) \n","\n","p∗ \n","\n","L-selectin (ng/ml) \n","\n","p∗ \n","\n","HD \n","HNL \n","\n","875 \n","\n","370 \n","\n","610 211 \n","\n","1140 \n","\n","0.0002 \n","0.0001 \n","\n","Controls \n","\n","178 \n","\n","48 \n","\n"," \n","\n","* \n","\n","Compared with healthy controls. \n","\n","1137 \n","625 \n","\n"," \n"," \n","\n"," \n","\n","Figure 1.

Adhesion molecules have also been demonstrated to function in the \n","\n","lymphocytes  also  mediate \n","\n","the  dissemination  of \n","\n","\fspread of HD [9, 10]. Therefore, we determined serum levels of soluble adhesion \n","molecules,  L-selectin  and  P-selectin  as  indicators  of  distinctive  clinical  and \n","biological behaviour of lymphoid malignancies. In this report we demonstrated that \n","serum concentrations of these adhesion receptors are increased in patients with HD \n","and NHL. Our results confirm and extend data published previously on the role of \n","distinct  adhesion  molecules  in  lymphomas.  Elevated  levels  of  circulating \n","intercellular  adhesion  molecule-1  were  reported \n","in  various  hematologic \n","malignancies  including  HD  [9,  10],  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  [10],  chronic \n","lymphocytic leukemia [11] and NHL [12, 13], and non-hematologic malignancies \n","[10, 13].

The  study  of  adhesion \n","molecule  expression  and  function  may  allow  a  better  understanding  of  the \n","malignant behavior of lymphoid cells.

Selectins comprise a family of adhesion receptors expressed by leukocytes, platelets and \n","endothelial cells. In this study, the serum levels of soluble L-selectin and P-selectin were measured in \n","patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Hodgkin’s disease and found to be significantly elevated \n","in both patient groups compared to healthy controls. This result provides evidence that alterations in \n","the expression and function of adhesion molecules may play an important role in the progression of \n","lymphomas.

Lymphocytes migrate from the circulation by selective attachment to specialized \n","endothelial  cells  lining  the  postcapillary  high  endothelial  venules  (HEV)  in \n","organized lymphoid tissues, lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches. Selectins comprise \n","a family of adhesion molecules which have been demonstrated to participate in the \n","initial  tetherting/rolling  of  leukocytes  on  activated  endothelium  [3].  L-selectin \n","(CD62L,  LAM-1,  LECAM-1)  mediates  the  binding  of  lymphocytes  to  HEV  of \n","peripheral lymph nodes through interactions with corresponding endothelial ligand \n","and  therefore  also  known  as  the  lymphocyte  homing  receptor  [4].

In  this  study,  serum  levels  of  soluble  L-selectin  and  P-selectin  were \n","determined  in  patients  with  HD  and  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  and  in \n","normal healthy individuals. \n","\n","PATIENTSANDMETHODS \n","\n","The study group consisted of 17 patients (10 NHL, 7 HD; 11 men, 6 women; median \n","age 35 years, range 19–70) and 15 healthy volunteers (11 men, 4 women; median \n","age 49 years, range 36–67).

Four \n","patients  out  of  7  with  HD  had  mixed  cellularity,  1  nodular  sclerosis,  and  2 \n","lymphocyte  predominance  type.  Staging  was  performed  according  to  the  Ann \n","Arbor system. In NHL, 2 patients had stage III and 8 patients had stage IV disease, \n","and in HD 1 patient had stage II, 2 stage III, and the remaining 4 stage IV disease. \n","All patients with HD and 3 out of 10 with NHL had B-symptoms. Serum L-selectin \n","and P-selectin levels were determined using a commercially available ELISA kit \n","(Bender  MedSystems,  Vienna,  Austria)  according \n","the  manufacturer’s \n","instructions.

These  results  suggest  the  presence  of  factors \n","other than sHLA-G that are able to control NK cell activation \n","in CLL.

The second set of results \n","indicates  that  the  presence  of  HLA-G  molecules  in  the \n","neoplastic environment, in either a soluble form or bound to \n","the membrane, creates a favorable setting for CLL expansion. \n","As  proof  of  this,  evaluation  of  the  impact  of  the  14  bp \n","polymorphism on the clinical outcome of the disease showed \n","that  del/del  patients  have  a  poorer  overall  survival than do \n","either  ins/del or ins/ins patients.  \n","\n","Taken together, our results support the view that HLA- \n","G molecules are part of the escape strategies designed by CLL \n","cells and indicate that a quantitative analysis of sHLA-G levels \n","may  be  of  clinical  relevance  in  the  management  of  CLL \n","patients. \n","\n","Funding \n","Work  supported  by  grants  from  the  Italian  Ministries  of \n","Education, University and Research (Futuro in Ricerca 2008 \n","# \n","RBFR08ATLH, PRIN 2009 # 2009LMEEEH_002 e # \n","NANLST_001, FIRB 2010 # RBAP11FXBC-005), Italian \n","Ministry  of  Health  (Bando  Giovani  Ricercatori  2008  #  GR-\n","2008- \n","1138053),  Associazione  Italiana  per  la  Ricerca  sul  Cancro \n","Foundation (Special Program Molecular Clinical Oncology 5 \n","x  1000  N.  10007;  My  First  AIRC  Grant  N.  13470  and  IG \n","12754), Fondazione Cariplo, Compagnia di San Paolo (N. \n","PMN_call_2012_0071)  and  local  funds  of  the  University  of \n","Turin (ex-60%).  \n","\n","The  Fondazione  Ricerca  Molinette  provided  valuable \n","\n","assistance and support. \n","\n"," \n","\n","The situation on the cell membrane is less defined: del/del \n","patients  more  frequently  expressed  higher  levels  of  the \n","molecule, although statistical significance was not reached. A \n","potential  explanation  for  this  finding  lies  in  the  relative \n","instability  of  HLA-G  molecules  on  the  CLL  cell  membrane. \n","Results showing a correlation between membrane and sHLA-\n","G  levels  support  the  view  that  the  main  mechanism  of \n","generation  of  sHLA-G  is  shedding  rather  than  alternative \n","splicing. This was confirmed by an analysis of HLA-G isoforms, \n","which demonstrated a dominance of sHLA-G1, generated by \n","proteolytic cleavage of membrane HLA-G1. No preference of \n","isoform according to the 14 bp polymorphism was noted, in \n","agreement with previously published data.31,32 \n","\n","A  reasonable  hypothesis  to  explain  this  result  is  that  the \n","membrane form represents a transitory step. A consequence \n","is  that  quantification  of  soluble  rather  than  surface  HLA-G \n","may  be  more  accurate.  This  is  also  in  line  with  previous \n","studies, which found that sHLA-G levels in plasma were higher \n","in  CLL  patients  than  in  healthy  controls.17,18  A  second  issue \n","favoring  the  view  that  quantification  of  soluble  rather  than \n","membrane  HLA-G  is  an  informative  and  dependable  assay \n","derives  from  old  and  new  facts  linked  to  the  unique  lipid \n","structure of the CLL cell surface,33,34 potentially increasing the \n","instability of the membrane form. In agreement with this, in \n","myeloma  cells  mHLA-G  is  also  released  from  the  cell \n","membrane  in  microparticles.35  These  findings  suggest  that \n","quantification  of  sHLA-G  may  be  clinically  useful  and  more \n","informative than analysis of the surface of tumor cells.  \n","\n","The  second  set  of  results  obtained  in  this  study  may  be \n","considered  as  tiles  creating  a  tolerogenic  mosaic,  in  which \n","HLA-G  molecules  represent  a  link  between  innate  and \n","adaptive  immunity.  Accordingly,  the  presence  of  a  del/del \n","genotype  (i.e.,  with  high  sHLA-G  levels)  is  paralleled  by  an \n","expansion  of  Treg  in  the  circulation.  Supportive  data  come \n","from other models, in which HLA-G is reported to induce Treg. \n","As an example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed \n","to  sHLA-G5  acquire  regulatory  features,  inhibiting  allo-\n","proliferative responses exerted by other T lymphocytes. It is \n","also  known  that  patients  receiving  combined  liver/kidney \n","transplants show high levels of sHLAG5, which correlate with \n","increased percentages of suppressor T cells.36 Similarly, stem-\n","cell transplanted patients have high levels of sHLA-G5 in the \n","peripheral  blood,  with  a  simultaneous  expansion  of \n","CD4+/CD25+/CD152+ T lymphocytes with suppressive activity. \n","Indirect confirmation in the CLL model may be deduced from \n","data  showing  that  an  increase  in  Treg  positively  correlates \n","with  the  presence  of  clinical  and  biological  features  of \n","aggressive disease.37 \n","\n","NK  cells  obtained  from  CLL  patients  have  less  cytotoxic \n","activity  than  NK  cell  populations  obtained  from  healthy \n","donors of a comparable age. This suggests that leukemic cells \n","directly affect NK cell viability and/or activity. This would be \n","achieved through binding HLA-G to the KIR2DL4 ligand, which \n","becomes  expressed  once  NK  cells  are  activated  in  the \n","presence  of  interleukin-2.

In this study, the serum levels of soluble L-selectin and P-selectin were measured in \n","patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Hodgkin’s disease and found to be significantly elevated \n","in both patient groups compared to healthy controls. This result provides evidence that alterations in \n","the expression and function of adhesion molecules may play an important role in the progression of \n","lymphomas. Further studies are awaited to establish the exact roles of these adhesion molecules in \n","distinct patterns of growth and spread of lymphomas. \n","\n","Key words: L-selectin; P-selectin; Hodgkin’s disease; non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. \n","\n","INTRODUCTION \n","\n","Adhesion of lymphocytes to endothelium is essential in lymphocyte trafficking [1, \n","2]. Lymphocytes migrate from the circulation by selective attachment to specialized \n","endothelial  cells  lining  the  postcapillary  high  endothelial  venules  (HEV)  in \n","organized lymphoid tissues, lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches.

In  this  study,  serum  levels  of  soluble  L-selectin  and  P-selectin  were \n","determined  in  patients  with  HD  and  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  and  in \n","normal healthy individuals. \n","\n","PATIENTSANDMETHODS \n","\n","The study group consisted of 17 patients (10 NHL, 7 HD; 11 men, 6 women; median \n","age 35 years, range 19–70) and 15 healthy volunteers (11 men, 4 women; median \n","age 49 years, range 36–67). Out of 10 NHL patients, 5 were classified as lowgrade, \n","1  intermediate,  and  4  high-grade  according  to  the  Working  Formulation.  Four \n","patients  out  of  7  with  HD  had  mixed  cellularity,  1  nodular  sclerosis,  and  2 \n","lymphocyte  predominance  type.  Staging  was  performed  according  to  the  Ann \n","Arbor system. In NHL, 2 patients had stage III and 8 patients had stage IV disease, \n","and in HD 1 patient had stage II, 2 stage III, and the remaining 4 stage IV disease. \n","All patients with HD and 3 out of 10 with NHL had B-symptoms. Serum L-selectin \n","and P-selectin levels were determined using a commercially available ELISA kit \n","(Bender  MedSystems,  Vienna,  Austria)  according \n","the  manufacturer’s \n","instructions.

In this study, the serum levels of soluble L-selectin and P-selectin were measured in \n","patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Hodgkin’s disease and found to be significantly elevated \n","in both patient groups compared to healthy controls.

L-selectin \n","(CD62L,  LAM-1,  LECAM-1)  mediates  the  binding  of  lymphocytes  to  HEV  of \n","peripheral lymph nodes through interactions with corresponding endothelial ligand \n","and  therefore  also  known  as  the  lymphocyte  homing  receptor  [4].

In  this  study,  serum  levels  of  soluble  L-selectin  and  P-selectin  were \n","determined  in  patients  with  HD  and  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  and  in \n","normal healthy individuals. \n","\n","PATIENTSANDMETHODS \n","\n","The study group consisted of 17 patients (10 NHL, 7 HD; 11 men, 6 women; median \n","age 35 years, range 19–70) and 15 healthy volunteers (11 men, 4 women; median \n","age 49 years, range 36–67). Out of 10 NHL patients, 5 were classified as lowgrade, \n","1  intermediate,  and  4  high-grade  according  to  the  Working  Formulation.  Four \n","patients  out  of  7  with  HD  had  mixed  cellularity,  1  nodular  sclerosis,  and  2 \n","lymphocyte  predominance  type.  Staging  was  performed  according  to  the  Ann \n","Arbor system. In NHL, 2 patients had stage III and 8 patients had stage IV disease, \n","and in HD 1 patient had stage II, 2 stage III, and the remaining 4 stage IV disease. \n","All patients with HD and 3 out of 10 with NHL had B-symptoms. Serum L-selectin \n","and P-selectin levels were determined using a commercially available ELISA kit \n","(Bender  MedSystems,  Vienna,  Austria)  according \n","the  manufacturer’s \n","instructions.

These  results  suggest  the  presence  of  factors \n","other than sHLA-G that are able to control NK cell activation \n","in CLL.

The second set of results \n","indicates  that  the  presence  of  HLA-G  molecules  in  the \n","neoplastic environment, in either a soluble form or bound to \n","the membrane, creates a favorable setting for CLL expansion. \n","As  proof  of  this,  evaluation  of  the  impact  of  the  14  bp \n","polymorphism on the clinical outcome of the disease showed \n","that  del/del  patients  have  a  poorer  overall  survival than do \n","either  ins/del or ins/ins patients.  \n","\n","Taken together, our results support the view that HLA- \n","G molecules are part of the escape strategies designed by CLL \n","cells and indicate that a quantitative analysis of sHLA-G levels \n","may  be  of  clinical  relevance  in  the  management  of  CLL \n","patients. \n","\n","Funding \n","Work  supported  by  grants  from  the  Italian  Ministries  of \n","Education, University and Research (Futuro in Ricerca 2008 \n","# \n","RBFR08ATLH, PRIN 2009 # 2009LMEEEH_002 e # \n","NANLST_001, FIRB 2010 # RBAP11FXBC-005), Italian \n","Ministry  of  Health  (Bando  Giovani  Ricercatori  2008  #  GR-\n","2008- \n","1138053),  Associazione  Italiana  per  la  Ricerca  sul  Cancro \n","Foundation (Special Program Molecular Clinical Oncology 5 \n","x  1000  N.  10007;  My  First  AIRC  Grant  N.  13470  and  IG \n","12754), Fondazione Cariplo, Compagnia di San Paolo (N. \n","PMN_call_2012_0071)  and  local  funds  of  the  University  of \n","Turin (ex-60%).  \n","\n","The  Fondazione  Ricerca  Molinette  provided  valuable \n","\n","assistance and support. \n","\n"," \n","\n","The situation on the cell membrane is less defined: del/del \n","patients  more  frequently  expressed  higher  levels  of  the \n","molecule, although statistical significance was not reached. A \n","potential  explanation  for  this  finding  lies  in  the  relative \n","instability  of  HLA-G  molecules  on  the  CLL  cell  membrane. \n","Results showing a correlation between membrane and sHLA-\n","G  levels  support  the  view  that  the  main  mechanism  of \n","generation  of  sHLA-G  is  shedding  rather  than  alternative \n","splicing. This was confirmed by an analysis of HLA-G isoforms, \n","which demonstrated a dominance of sHLA-G1, generated by \n","proteolytic cleavage of membrane HLA-G1. No preference of \n","isoform according to the 14 bp polymorphism was noted, in \n","agreement with previously published data.31,32 \n","\n","A  reasonable  hypothesis  to  explain  this  result  is  that  the \n","membrane form represents a transitory step. A consequence \n","is  that  quantification  of  soluble  rather  than  surface  HLA-G \n","may  be  more  accurate.  This  is  also  in  line  with  previous \n","studies, which found that sHLA-G levels in plasma were higher \n","in  CLL  patients  than  in  healthy  controls.17,18  A  second  issue \n","favoring  the  view  that  quantification  of  soluble  rather  than \n","membrane  HLA-G  is  an  informative  and  dependable  assay \n","derives  from  old  and  new  facts  linked  to  the  unique  lipid \n","structure of the CLL cell surface,33,34 potentially increasing the \n","instability of the membrane form. In agreement with this, in \n","myeloma  cells  mHLA-G  is  also  released  from  the  cell \n","membrane  in  microparticles.35  These  findings  suggest  that \n","quantification  of  sHLA-G  may  be  clinically  useful  and  more \n","informative than analysis of the surface of tumor cells.  \n","\n","The  second  set  of  results  obtained  in  this  study  may  be \n","considered  as  tiles  creating  a  tolerogenic  mosaic,  in  which \n","HLA-G  molecules  represent  a  link  between  innate  and \n","adaptive  immunity.  Accordingly,  the  presence  of  a  del/del \n","genotype  (i.e.,  with  high  sHLA-G  levels)  is  paralleled  by  an \n","expansion  of  Treg  in  the  circulation.  Supportive  data  come \n","from other models, in which HLA-G is reported to induce Treg. \n","As an example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed \n","to  sHLA-G5  acquire  regulatory  features,  inhibiting  allo-\n","proliferative responses exerted by other T lymphocytes. It is \n","also  known  that  patients  receiving  combined  liver/kidney \n","transplants show high levels of sHLAG5, which correlate with \n","increased percentages of suppressor T cells.36 Similarly, stem-\n","cell transplanted patients have high levels of sHLA-G5 in the \n","peripheral  blood,  with  a  simultaneous  expansion  of \n","CD4+/CD25+/CD152+ T lymphocytes with suppressive activity. \n","Indirect confirmation in the CLL model may be deduced from \n","data  showing  that  an  increase  in  Treg  positively  correlates \n","with  the  presence  of  clinical  and  biological  features  of \n","aggressive disease.37 \n","\n","NK  cells  obtained  from  CLL  patients  have  less  cytotoxic \n","activity  than  NK  cell  populations  obtained  from  healthy \n","donors of a comparable age. This suggests that leukemic cells \n","directly affect NK cell viability and/or activity. This would be \n","achieved through binding HLA-G to the KIR2DL4 ligand, which \n","becomes  expressed  once  NK  cells  are  activated  in  the \n","presence  of  interleukin-2.

C. </br></br>Abstract—The migration of normal and malignant lymphoid cells is governed by specific adhesion </br>molecules. Selectins comprise a family of adhesion receptors expressed by leukocytes, platelets and </br>endothelial cells. In this study, the serum levels of soluble L-selectin and P-selectin were measured in </br>patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Hodgkin’s disease and found to be significantly elevated </br>in both patient groups compared to healthy controls. This result provides evidence that alterations in </br>the expression and function of adhesion molecules may play an important role in the progression of </br>lymphomas. Further studies are awaited to establish the exact roles of these adhesion molecules in </br>distinct patterns of growth and spread of lymphomas. </br></br>Key words: L-selectin; P-selectin; Hodgkin’s disease; non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. </br></br>INTRODUCTION </br></br>Adhesion of lymphocytes to endothelium is essential in lymphocyte trafficking [1, </br>2]. Lymphocytes migrate from the circulation by selective attachment to specialized </br>endothelial  cells  lining  the  postcapillary  high  endothelial  venules  (HEV)  in </br>organized lymphoid tissues, lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches. Selectins comprise </br>a family of adhesion molecules which have been demonstrated to participate in the </br>initial  tetherting/rolling  of  leukocytes  on  activated  endothelium  [3].  L-selectin </br>(CD62L,  LAM-1,  LECAM-1)  mediates  the  binding  of  lymphocytes  to  HEV  of </br>peripheral lymph nodes through interactions with corresponding endothelial ligand </br>and  therefore  also  known  as  the  lymphocyte  homing  receptor  [4].  P-selectin </br>(CD62P, PADGEM, GMP-140) is stored both in the alpha granules in platelets and </br></br>Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells [5] and involved in the stabilization of </br></br>\f </br></br>∗To whom correspondence should be addressed.

A </br>similar  adhesion  mechanism  is  also  utilized  by  malignant  lymphoid  cells  during </br>dissemination [7, 8]. Altered expression patterns of adhesion molecules appear to </br>be involved in the spread of lymphoid malignancies and Hodgkin’s disease (HD) </br>[7–10].  In  this  study,  serum  levels  of  soluble  L-selectin  and  P-selectin  were </br>determined  in  patients  with  HD  and  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  and  in </br>normal healthy individuals. </br></br>PATIENTSANDMETHODS </br></br>The study group consisted of 17 patients (10 NHL, 7 HD; 11 men, 6 women; median </br>age 35 years, range 19–70) and 15 healthy volunteers (11 men, 4 women; median </br>age 49 years, range 36–67). Out of 10 NHL patients, 5 were classified as lowgrade, </br>1  intermediate,  and  4  high-grade  according  to  the  Working  Formulation.  Four </br>patients  out  of  7  with  HD  had  mixed  cellularity,  1  nodular  sclerosis,  and  2 </br>lymphocyte  predominance  type.  Staging  was  performed  according  to  the  Ann </br>Arbor system. In NHL, 2 patients had stage III and 8 patients had stage IV disease, </br>and in HD 1 patient had stage II, 2 stage III, and the remaining 4 stage IV disease. </br>All patients with HD and 3 out of 10 with NHL had B-symptoms. Serum L-selectin </br>and P-selectin levels were determined using a commercially available ELISA kit </br>(Bender  MedSystems,  Vienna,  Austria)  according </br>the  manufacturer’s </br>instructions. Data are presented as mean ± SD. Mann–Whitney U test was used for </br>statistical analysis. </br></br>to </br></br>RESULTS </br></br>Adhesion  molecule  levels  were  significantly  higher  in  lymphoma  patients </br>compared to healthy controls (Table 1) (Fig. 1). Serum levels of sL-Selectin (1137 </br>± 428 ng/ml vs 625 ± 159 ng/ml; p = 0.0023 and sP-Selectin (610 ± 211 ng/ml vs </br>178  ±  48  ng/ml;  p  =  0.0001)  were  significantly  increased  in  patients  with  non-</br>Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  compared  to  the  control  group.  In  HD,  serum  soluble  L-</br>selectin (1140 ± 498 ng/ml; p = 0.0082) and P-selectin (875 ± 370 ng/ml; p = 0.0002) </br>concentrations were significantly elevated also compared to healthy controls (625 </br>± 159 ng/ml and 178 ± 48 ng/ml for L-selectin and P-selectin, respectively). </br></br>\fDISCUSSION </br></br>Disseminating  malignant </br>characteristics, </br>interactions [7, 8]. </br></br>including  migration  and  extravasation </br></br>lymphoma  cells  and  lymphocytes  share  several </br>involving  adhesive </br></br>Adhesion molecules in lymphomas </br></br>29 </br></br>Table 1. </br>Serum soluble P-selectin and L-selectin levels in the study group </br></br>Patients </br></br>P-selectin (ng/ml) </br></br>p∗ </br></br>L-selectin (ng/ml) </br></br>p∗ </br></br>HD </br>HNL </br></br>875 </br></br>370 </br></br>610 211 </br></br>1140 </br></br>0.0002 </br>0.0001 </br></br>Controls </br></br>178 </br></br>48 </br></br> </br></br>* </br></br>Compared with healthy controls. </br></br>1137 </br>625 </br></br> </br> </br></br> </br></br>Figure 1. Circulating soluble P-selectin and L-selectin levels in the study group. </br></br> </br></br>Emerging evidence indicates that the adhesion molecules governing the homing of </br>normal </br>their  neoplastic </br>counterparts. Adhesion molecules have also been demonstrated to function in the </br></br>lymphocytes  also  mediate </br></br>the  dissemination  of </br></br>\fspread of HD [9, 10]. Therefore, we determined serum levels of soluble adhesion </br>molecules,  L-selectin  and  P-selectin  as  indicators  of  distinctive  clinical  and </br>biological behaviour of lymphoid malignancies. In this report we demonstrated that </br>serum concentrations of these adhesion receptors are increased in patients with HD </br>and NHL. Our results confirm and extend data published previously on the role of </br>distinct  adhesion  molecules  in  lymphomas.  Elevated  levels  of  circulating </br>intercellular  adhesion  molecule-1  were  reported </br>in  various  hematologic </br>malignancies  including  HD  [9,  10],  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  [10],  chronic </br>lymphocytic leukemia [11] and NHL [12, 13], and non-hematologic malignancies </br>[10, 13]. To our knowledge, </br>I. C. Haznedaroˇglu et al. </br></br>30 </br></br>this report is the first investigating the levels of circulating L-selectin and P-selectin </br>in NHL and HD. </br></br>Differential  expression  of  these  adhesion  molecules  may  account  for  diverse </br>patterns  of  growth  and  dissemination  of  lymphomas.  The  study  of  adhesion </br>molecule  expression  and  function  may  allow  a  better  understanding  of  the </br>malignant behavior of lymphoid cells. Our data need to be validated and extended </br>in a more homogenous patient series in order to elucidate the clinical and prognostic </br>significance of L-selectin and P-selectin in lymphomas. </br></br>REFERENCES </br></br>1.

C. </br></br>Abstract—The migration of normal and malignant lymphoid cells is governed by specific adhesion </br>molecules. Selectins comprise a family of adhesion receptors expressed by leukocytes, platelets and </br>endothelial cells. In this study, the serum levels of soluble L-selectin and P-selectin were measured in </br>patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and Hodgkin’s disease and found to be significantly elevated </br>in both patient groups compared to healthy controls. This result provides evidence that alterations in </br>the expression and function of adhesion molecules may play an important role in the progression of </br>lymphomas. Further studies are awaited to establish the exact roles of these adhesion molecules in </br>distinct patterns of growth and spread of lymphomas. </br></br>Key words: L-selectin; P-selectin; Hodgkin’s disease; non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. </br></br>INTRODUCTION </br></br>Adhesion of lymphocytes to endothelium is essential in lymphocyte trafficking [1, </br>2]. Lymphocytes migrate from the circulation by selective attachment to specialized </br>endothelial  cells  lining  the  postcapillary  high  endothelial  venules  (HEV)  in </br>organized lymphoid tissues, lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches. Selectins comprise </br>a family of adhesion molecules which have been demonstrated to participate in the </br>initial  tetherting/rolling  of  leukocytes  on  activated  endothelium  [3].  L-selectin </br>(CD62L,  LAM-1,  LECAM-1)  mediates  the  binding  of  lymphocytes  to  HEV  of </br>peripheral lymph nodes through interactions with corresponding endothelial ligand </br>and  therefore  also  known  as  the  lymphocyte  homing  receptor  [4].  P-selectin </br>(CD62P, PADGEM, GMP-140) is stored both in the alpha granules in platelets and </br></br>Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells [5] and involved in the stabilization of </br></br>\f </br></br>∗To whom correspondence should be addressed.

A </br>similar  adhesion  mechanism  is  also  utilized  by  malignant  lymphoid  cells  during </br>dissemination [7, 8]. Altered expression patterns of adhesion molecules appear to </br>be involved in the spread of lymphoid malignancies and Hodgkin’s disease (HD) </br>[7–10].  In  this  study,  serum  levels  of  soluble  L-selectin  and  P-selectin  were </br>determined  in  patients  with  HD  and  non-Hodgkin’s  lymphoma  (NHL)  and  in </br>normal healthy individuals. </br></br>PATIENTSANDMETHODS </br></br>The study group consisted of 17 patients (10 NHL, 7 HD; 11 men, 6 women; median </br>age 35 years, range 19–70) and 15 healthy volunteers (11 men, 4 women; median </br>age 49 years, range 36–67). Out of 10 NHL patients, 5 were classified as lowgrade, </br>1  intermediate,  and  4  high-grade  according  to  the  Working  Formulation.  Four </br>patients  out  of  7  with  HD  had  mixed  cellularity,  1  nodular  sclerosis,  and  2 </br>lymphocyte  predominance  type.  Staging  was  performed  according  to  the  Ann </br>Arbor system. In NHL, 2 patients had stage III and 8 patients had stage IV disease, </br>and in HD 1 patient had stage II, 2 stage III, and the remaining 4 stage IV disease. </br>All patients with HD and 3 out of 10 with NHL had B-symptoms. Serum L-selectin </br>and P-selectin levels were determined using a commercially available ELISA kit </br>(Bender  MedSystems,  Vienna,  Austria)  according </br>the  manufacturer’s </br>instructions. Data are presented as mean ± SD. Mann–Whitney U test was used for </br>statistical analysis. </br></br>to </br></br>RESULTS </br></br>Adhesion  molecule  levels  were  significantly  higher  in  lymphoma  patients </br>compared to healthy controls (Table 1) (Fig. 1).

Adhesion molecules have also been demonstrated to function in the </br></br>lymphocytes  also  mediate </br></br>the  dissemination  of </br></br>\fspread of HD [9, 10]. Therefore, we determined serum levels of soluble adhesion </br>molecules,  L-selectin  and  P-selectin  as  indicators  of  distinctive  clinical  and </br>biological behaviour of lymphoid malignancies. In this report we demonstrated that </br>serum concentrations of these adhesion receptors are increased in patients with HD </br>and NHL. Our results confirm and extend data published previously on the role of </br>distinct  adhesion  molecules  in  lymphomas.  Elevated  levels  of  circulating </br>intercellular  adhesion  molecule-1  were  reported </br>in  various  hematologic </br>malignancies  including  HD  [9,  10],  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  [10],  chronic </br>lymphocytic leukemia [11] and NHL [12, 13], and non-hematologic malignancies </br>[10, 13].

Haznedaroˇglu et al. </br></br>30 </br></br>this report is the first investigating the levels of circulating L-selectin and P-selectin </br>in NHL and HD. </br></br>Differential  expression  of  these  adhesion  molecules  may  account  for  diverse </br>patterns  of  growth  and  dissemination  of  lymphomas.  The  study  of  adhesion </br>molecule  expression  and  function  may  allow  a  better  understanding  of  the </br>malignant behavior of lymphoid cells. Our data need to be validated and extended </br>in a more homogenous patient series in order to elucidate the clinical and prognostic </br>significance of L-selectin and P-selectin in lymphomas. </br></br>REFERENCES </br></br>1.

A  14  base  pair  insertion/deletion  polymorphism </br>(rs66554220) in the 3'-untranslated region of HLA-G influences mRNA stability and protein expression. The analysis of </br>a cohort of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia confirmed that del/del individuals are characterized by higher </br>levels  of  surface  and  soluble  HLA-G  than  subjects  with  the  other  two  genotypes.  In  line  with  its  role  in </br>immunomodulation, the percentage of regulatory T lymphocytes is higher in del/del patients than in patients with the </br>other  genotypes  and  correlates  with  the  amounts  of  surface  or  soluble  HLA-G.  Furthermore,  addition  of  sHLAG-rich </br>plasma from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia induces natural killer cell apoptosis and impairs natural killer </br>cell lysis, with effects proportional to the amount of soluble \n","<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #3cb44b; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n","    HLA-G\n","    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">DRUG</span>\n","</mark>\n"," added. Lastly, the presence of an HLAG 14 base pair </br>polymorphism is of prognostic value, with del/del patients showing reduced overall survival, as compared to those with </br>other genotypes. These results suggest that: (i) the HLA-G 14 base pair polymorphism influences the levels of surface </br>and  soluble  HLA-G  expression,  and  (ii)  the  over-expression  of  HLA-G  molecules  contributes  to  creating  tolerogenic </br>conditions.  </br></br> </br></br> </br></br>888 </br></br> </br></br> </br></br>\fH L A - G   p o l y m o r p h i s m   i n   C L L </br></br> </br>Introduction </br></br>First,  CLL </br></br>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common type of </br>adult leukemia in Caucasian populations, is characterized by the </br>progressive  accumulation  of  mature  CD5+/CD23+  B  cells  in  the </br>peripheral  blood  and  lymphoid  organs.1  Several  observations </br>point to immune escape being a relevant mechanism of tumor </br>promotion. </br>levels  of </br>immunomodulatory  factors  (e.g.,  transforming  growth  factor2 </br>and interleukin-103), which suppress responses to \n","<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #3cb44b; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n","    antigens\n","    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">DRUG</span>\n","</mark>\n"," and </br>influence  activation,  expansion,  and  effector  functions  of  T </br>lymphocytes.4 Secondly, an increase in the numbers of circulating </br>regulatory  T  cells  (Treg)  parallels  disease  progression.5,6  Lastly, </br>\n","<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #3cb44b; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n","    adenosine\n","    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">DRUG</span>\n","</mark>\n","  production  in  the  extracellular  milieu  by  selected </br>leukemic subpopulations shields the CLL clone from the actions </br>of the immune system.7 </br></br>cells  express  high </br></br>The  aim  of  this  work  was  to  investigate  the  role  of  human </br>leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) as a further strategy adopted by CLL </br>cells to evade immune defenses and to create protected niches </br>in  which  to  grow  and  expand.  HLA-G  is  a  non-classical  major </br>histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I product with </br></br>limited sequence variability.

Results  indicate  a  marked  variability  in </br>concentration in both CLL patients (mean ± SEM, 19.71±2.83 </br>ng/mL)  and  controls  (mean  ±  SEM,  17.28±23.64  ng/mL), </br>without statistically significant  differences between the two </br>groups  (Figure  2A).  When  CLL  patients  and  controls  were </br>divided  according  to  genotype,  del/del  patients  (n=27)  had </br>significantly higher levels of sHLA-G (mean 30.82±4.8 ng/mL) </br>than  had  either  ins/del  (n=18,  mean  13.68±3.67  ng/mL, </br>P=0.015, Mann-Whitney test) or ins/ins patients (n=15, mean </br>6.95±2.74  ng/mL,  P=0.003,  Mann-Whitney  test,  Figure  2B). </br>Del/del  controls  showed  a  tendency  towards  a  higher </br>production of sHLAG (n=22, mean 22.06±27.32 ng/mL) when </br>compared  to  ins/del  (n=25,  mean  16.93±24.87  ng/mL)  or </br>ins/ins (n=13, mean 9.88 ± 11.90 ng/mL) individuals, without </br>the  difference  reaching  statistical  significance </br>(Online </br>Supplementary Figure S1A). After dividing sHLA-G levels into </br>quartiles,  25%  of  CLL  patients  and  of  controls  had  sHLA-G </br>expression above the third quartile (third quartile value in CLL </br>patients: 31.75 ng/mL; third quartile value in controls: 24.40 </br>ng/mL).  Of  these,  in  the  CLL  cohort  80%  had  a  del/del </br>genotype,  while  13%  had  an  ins/del  genotype  and  the </br>remaining 7% had an ins/ins genotype (P&lt;0.0001, Fisher exact </br>test, Figure 2C). When considering controls, 46% presented a </br>del/del,  46%  an </br>ins/ins  genotype </br>(P&lt;0.0001,  Fisher  exact  test,  Online  Supplementary  Figure </br>S1B). </br></br>ins/del  and  8%  an </br></br>We then asked whether sHLA-G levels correlate with HLA-G </br>expressed  on  the  membrane  of  CLL  cells.  As  expected,  the </br>levels  of  expression  of  sHLA-G  and  membrane  HLA-G  were </br>positively  correlated  (n=60,  rho=0.4,  P=0.003,  Spearman </br>correlation test), in line with a relationship between surface </br>HLA-G  expression  and  release  (Figure  2D).

To this aim, the composition of T-</br>cell subsets was assessed in 52 CLL patients divided according </br>to HLA-G 14 bp polymorphism. </br></br>CD4+ and CD8+ and T-cell percentages were not significantly </br>different  among  the  groups  with  the  three  HLA-G  14  bp </br>genotypes  (Figure  3A,B).  In  contrast,  the  number  of  Treg, </br>defined as CD4+/CD25high/CD127low), was significantly higher in </br>patients with the del/del genotype (mean 6.97% ± 0.88) than </br>in the group with the ins/ins genotype </br>(mean 3.23% ± 0.69, P=0.006, Mann-Whitney test, Figure 3C). </br>Heterozygous  patients  displayed  intermediate  values,  not </br>significantly  different  from  those  in  either  the  ins/ins  or </br>del/del  homozygous  patients  (mean  5.77%  ±  0.78).

The  effect  was </br>directly  correlated  to  sHLA-G </br>in  plasma,  with </br>significantly  lower  survival  of  the  NK  cells  when  exposed  to </br>plasma from patients with sHLA-G &gt;31.75 ng/mL as compared </br>to  plasma  from  patients  with  undetectable  sHLA-G  (Figure </br>4D). </br></br>levels </br></br>r</br>ynell</br></br>epiyt</br></br>e</br>t</br></br>e</br>snnonais</br></br>l</br> </br>i</br></br>l</br>ete</br>tlit</br></br>s</br>rs</br>ysyna.i. </br></br> .</br></br>nt  ( t</br></br> </br></br>i</br>g</br></br>(ii(C</br></br>E</br></br>n</br></br>sg</br></br>ncMFe </br></br> </br></br>v</br></br> ) </br></br>hw)t  a</br></br>s</br>a</br>F</br></br>l</br>e</br>cbiI</br> oEhiT</br>fxet)</br></br>u</br></br>ht</br></br>v</br></br> ih p </br></br>a</br>citr</br></br>e</br>e</br>lvi aryeou </br></br>tn</br></br>i</br>ieittt</br></br>lnnn</br></br> </br>i</br></br>o</br></br>liysc o</br></br>C</br></br>n</br></br> hd sl</br></br> oyo.</br></br>L</br></br>piie </br></br> </br></br>oL</br></br>osbb(f</br></br>otD inite</br></br>f </br></br>sittan</br></br> p</br></br>) eoc.</br></br>t</br></br>ah</br></br>o  it</br></br>PtnrSnefay</br></br>te</br></br>i</br> teperK</br></br>e </br></br> bi</br></br>N</br></br>lerade</br></br>eIlc</br></br>n</br></br>fRela ue </br></br>t</br></br>K</br>f</br></br>u</br></br>o re2kn</br></br>s</br> </br>ssm</br></br>fc</br></br>c</br></br> </br>D</br></br>oiti ni</br></br>a</br>nta</br></br>e</br>lanL u-</br></br>n</br></br>gog</br></br>l</br>2n 4</br></br>d </br></br>l</br>bv </br></br>c</br>fe -p</br></br> </br> i lac</br></br>i Cte</br></br>o</br></br>i</br>nlo</br></br>roca</br></br>n</br></br>L o</br></br>m</br></br> fHters</br></br> </br></br>1</br></br> LieN</br></br>p</br></br>fimvL</br></br> nfspa</br></br>1</br></br>a</br></br> </br>ttcalte</br></br>r</br> ia-</br>eicn</br></br>h</br></br> </br></br>KAi</br></br>t</br>G</br></br>ersdde</br></br>m</br></br>e</br>.nmee l  </br></br>a</br></br>(ltHau</br></br>e</br>rG  </br></br>l</br>aivn(k</br></br>tn</br></br>h</br></br>Dv)ri </br></br>t</br>deia o</br>h-Rn</br></br>y </br></br>i</br>N dbno</br></br> </br>i</br></br>n</br>-</br></br>en2 Ki</br></br>d</br></br> </br> )Nlfg</br></br>o</br>C</br>r</br></br> ti-</br></br> atearcKoy</br></br>n</br></br>gl</br></br>L</br></br>ne</br></br>rcem  l</br></br>oL</br></br>r</br> </br>s</br>sdcitelnil</br></br>e  vsu</br></br>ps</br></br>t </br></br>pilta hok</br></br> a</br></br>lhaa </br></br>(</br>tenil</br></br>tc</br></br>i</br>eetgny</br></br>  i</br></br>oe</br></br>sdlc ae-ip2</br></br>n</br>n</br>i</br></br>on insNrn-</br></br>tt</br></br>reeta </br></br>rs</br></br>rswKs </br></br>o</br></br> </br></br>t</br>st  </br></br>l</br> tcsch</br>ae</br></br>sec</br></br>sy</br></br>Kisnpaevo</br></br>5 </br></br>acotlsw</br></br>le6etnst</br></br>p)</br></br> </br></br>ew</br></br>d</br></br>i</br>eigu</br></br>t</br>  2dn</br></br> </br>fo</br></br>fh</br></br>dod</br></br>o</br></br>r igf</br></br>on rti</br></br> </br></br> N eais</br></br>ra</br></br> </br>amgz</br></br> </br>dKHre</br></br>  </br></br>t</br></br>ch</br></br>gnP</br></br>   Ldcice</br></br>en</br></br>o</br></br>e</br></br>Ao vet</br></br>m</br></br>go </br></br> </br></br>1</br></br> na-pl</br></br>acnGltlsa</br></br>p4</br></br>eut r- tit</br></br>a</br> </br>holf</br></br>b</br></br>evhil</br></br>r</br>r</br>elise oseg</br></br>ap</br></br>a n  mh i</br></br>b</br>c</br></br> </br></br>p</br></br>(rnbt</br></br>ce </br></br>l</br>os</br>a a </br></br>e</br>i</br></br>o</br></br> C trrpwns</br></br>l</br> </br>hr</br>cL</br></br>ay</br></br>eirdleisLo</br></br>m</br></br>g</br></br>l   ah svsp</br></br>e</br>op</br></br>o</br></br> </br>tHi )</br></br>rfhdai </br></br>ra</br></br>p</br></br>oe oL</br></br>n</br></br>ieHtg</br></br>h</br></br>nsriA</br></br>de Leh</br></br>d</br></br> C-b.</br></br>i</br>nAGn  </br></br>s </br></br>m</br>t</br></br>Ll(e</br></br>m</br></br>et</br></br>e-c-HLsGtlevow. )</br></br>a.</br></br>p  </br></br> </br>e  w</br></br>(</br>l</br>oe</br>DgG</br>al</br></br>eA</br></br>esa rertp</br></br>:</br>  na</br></br>)</br>i</br></br>f</br> </br>tnoae</br></br>e</br>l</br>aopa</br></br>P</br></br> fbn</br></br>m</br></br>t  thsa</br></br>e</br>hsstym s</br></br>r</br>a</br>roe</br></br>c</br>epr</br></br>e eln</br></br>l</br> e(au</br></br>ee</br></br> aspec. </br></br>n</br></br> </br>b</br></br>r</br>t</br>r</br>mq fexr</br></br>leu</br></br>a</br></br>a</br>p eo</br></br>oosar</br></br>t</br></br>g</br></br>i</br>uH</br></br>o</br> </br></br>eefr</br></br> m</br></br> </br></br>894 </br></br>haematologica | 2014; 129(5) </br></br> </br></br>We next asked whether KIR2DL4, the main HLA-G ligand,30 </br>was expressed by NK cells. While resting NK cells from normal </br>donors and from CLL patients lacked KIR2DL4, the ligand was </br>induced  upon  interleukin-2mediated  NK  cell  activation,  in </br>agreement with published data30 (Figure 4C). Representative </br>expression plots are reported in Online Supplementary Figure </br>S2, showing results from an experiment in which decidual NK </br>cells  were  used  as  a  positive  control.  No  differential </br></br>expression  in  KIR2DL4  was  noted  in  HLA-G  typed  patients </br>(data not shown). The next step was to test whether sHLA-G </br>present  in  plasma  could  induce  apoptosis  or  inhibit  the </br>cytolytic function of NK cells obtained from normal donors. To </br>answer  this  question,  we  used  plasma  from  CLL  patients </br>containing  different  levels  of  sHLA-G  to  interfere  with  the </br>viability  and  cytotoxic  activity  of  NK  cells.

At an E:T ratio of </br>10:1 donor NK cells in the absence of CLL plasma efficiently </br>killed target cells (mean 85% ± 1.63), while in the presence of </br>CLL  plasma  samples  with  detectable  sHLA-G,  the  cytolytic </br>activity  was  sharply  reduced  (mean  27.38%  ±  4.72).  CLL </br></br>plasma samples with no sHLA-G were used as the control. The </br>presence  of  NK  cell  inhibition  also  in  the  presence  of  CLL </br>plasma  samples  with  undetectable  sHLA-G  suggests  the </br>presence  of  other  factors  implicated  in  NK  cell  activation </br>control. However, the degree of inhibition correlated with the </br>concentrations  of  sHLA-G  (Figure  4F).

This issue was approached by </br>testing  the  frequency  of  the  HLA-G  14  bp  polymorphism  in </br>506 CLL patients (Online </br>Supplementary Table S1). The genotype frequencies were in </br>Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium: 176/506 patients (34.8%) were </br>del/del homozygous, 81/506 (16%) were ins/ins homozygous </br>and </br>ins/del </br>heterozygous. None of the demographic (age and sex), clinical </br>(disease  stage,  splenomegaly,  lymph  node  size),  laboratory </br>(lactate  dehydrogenase  or  β2-microglobulin </br>levels),  or </br>molecular variables (CD38, ZAP-70, IGHV mutational status, </br>chromosomal aberrations) showed a preferential association </br>with the HLA-G polymorphism (Online Supplementary Table </br>S1). According to the survival analysis, patients harboring the </br>del/del genotype had a </br>shorter survival than patients harboring the ins/del or ins/ins </br>genotype  (P=0.027,  log-rank  test,  Figure  5A).  Consistently, </br>CLL patients with sHLA-G levels above the third quartile had a </br>shorter  survival  (median,  63.9  months)  than  patients  with </br>sHLA-G levels below the third quartile (median, 71.5 months, </br>P=0.0215,  log-rank  test;  Figure  5B),  and  CLL  patients  with </br>plasma samples showing inhibitory effects on NK cells showed </br>a trend towards having a shorter survival than patients whose </br>plasma lacked inhibitory effects (P=0.147, log-rank test, data </br>not shown).  </br></br>(49.2%)  were </br></br>Discussion </br></br>HLA-G  is  a  non-classical  HLA  protein  that  works  by </br>modulating  the  main  functions  of  NK  cells  and  Treg.

Furthermore, lysis inhibition was </br>also proportional to the amount of sHLA-G. It is worth noting </br>that CLL plasma samples with undetectable sHLA-G were able </br>to induce moderate NK cell apoptosis and to reduce NK cell </br>cytotoxicity.  These  results  suggest  the  presence  of  factors </br>other than sHLA-G that are able to control NK cell activation </br>in CLL. As expected, NK cell function of del/del patients was </br>more impaired than that of ins/del or ins/ins patients.  </br></br>In conclusion, the data obtained in this study provide two </br>different sets of information.

The second set of results </br>indicates  that  the  presence  of  HLA-G  molecules  in  the </br>neoplastic environment, in either a soluble form or bound to </br>the membrane, creates a favorable setting for CLL expansion. </br>As  proof  of  this,  evaluation  of  the  impact  of  the  14  bp </br>polymorphism on the clinical outcome of the disease showed </br>that  del/del  patients  have  a  poorer  overall  survival than do </br>either  ins/del or ins/ins patients.  </br></br>Taken together, our results support the view that HLA- </br>G molecules are part of the escape strategies designed by CLL </br>cells and indicate that a quantitative analysis of sHLA-G levels </br>may  be  of  clinical  relevance  in  the  management  of  CLL </br>patients. </br></br>Funding </br>Work  supported  by  grants  from  the  Italian  Ministries  of </br>Education, University and Research (Futuro in Ricerca 2008 </br># </br>RBFR08ATLH, PRIN 2009 # 2009LMEEEH_002 e # </br>NANLST_001, FIRB 2010 # RBAP11FXBC-005), Italian </br>Ministry  of  Health  (Bando  Giovani  Ricercatori  2008  #  GR-</br>2008- </br>1138053),  Associazione  Italiana  per  la  Ricerca  sul  Cancro </br>Foundation (Special Program Molecular Clinical Oncology 5 </br>x  1000  N.  10007;  My  First  AIRC  Grant  N.  13470  and  IG </br>12754), Fondazione Cariplo, Compagnia di San Paolo (N. </br>PMN_call_2012_0071)  and  local  funds  of  the  University  of </br>Turin (ex-60%).  </br></br>The  Fondazione  Ricerca  Molinette  provided  valuable </br></br>assistance and support. </br></br> </br></br>The situation on the cell membrane is less defined: del/del </br>patients  more  frequently  expressed  higher  levels  of  the </br>molecule, although statistical significance was not reached. A </br>potential  explanation  for  this  finding  lies  in  the  relative </br>instability  of  HLA-G  molecules  on  the  CLL  cell  membrane. </br>Results showing a correlation between membrane and sHLA-</br>G  levels  support  the  view  that  the  main  mechanism  of </br>generation  of  sHLA-G  is  shedding  rather  than  alternative </br>splicing. This was confirmed by an analysis of HLA-G isoforms, </br>which demonstrated a dominance of sHLA-G1, generated by </br>proteolytic cleavage of membrane HLA-G1. No preference of </br>isoform according to the 14 bp polymorphism was noted, in </br>agreement with previously published data.31,32 </br></br>A  reasonable  hypothesis  to  explain  this  result  is  that  the </br>membrane form represents a transitory step. A consequence </br>is  that  quantification  of  soluble  rather  than  surface  HLA-G </br>may  be  more  accurate.  This  is  also  in  line  with  previous </br>studies, which found that sHLA-G levels in plasma were higher </br>in  CLL  patients  than  in  healthy  controls.17,18  A  second  issue </br>favoring  the  view  that  quantification  of  soluble  rather  than </br>membrane  HLA-G  is  an  informative  and  dependable  assay </br>derives  from  old  and  new  facts  linked  to  the  unique  lipid </br>structure of the CLL cell surface,33,34 potentially increasing the </br>instability of the membrane form. In agreement with this, in </br>myeloma  cells  mHLA-G  is  also  released  from  the  cell </br>membrane  in  microparticles.35  These  findings  suggest  that </br>quantification  of  sHLA-G  may  be  clinically  useful  and  more </br>informative than analysis of the surface of tumor cells.  </br></br>The  second  set  of  results  obtained  in  this  study  may  be </br>considered  as  tiles  creating  a  tolerogenic  mosaic,  in  which </br>HLA-G  molecules  represent  a  link  between  innate  and </br>adaptive  immunity.  Accordingly,  the  presence  of  a  del/del </br>genotype  (i.e.,  with  high  sHLA-G  levels)  is  paralleled  by  an </br>expansion  of  Treg  in  the  circulation.  Supportive  data  come </br>from other models, in which HLA-G is reported to induce \n","<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #3cb44b; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n","    Treg\n","    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">DRUG</span>\n","</mark>\n",". </br>As an example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed </br>to  sHLA-G5  acquire  regulatory  features,  inhibiting  allo-</br>proliferative responses exerted by other T lymphocytes. It is </br>also  known  that  patients  receiving  combined  liver/kidney </br>transplants show high levels of sHLAG5, which correlate with </br>increased percentages of suppressor T cells.36 Similarly, stem-</br>cell transplanted patients have high levels of sHLA-G5 in the </br>peripheral  blood,  with  a  simultaneous  expansion  of </br>CD4+/CD25+/CD152+ T lymphocytes with suppressive activity. </br>Indirect confirmation in the CLL model may be deduced from </br>data  showing  that  an  increase  in  Treg  positively  correlates </br>with  the  presence  of  clinical  and  biological  features  of </br>aggressive disease.37 </br></br>NK  cells  obtained  from  CLL  patients  have  less  cytotoxic </br>activity  than  NK  cell  populations  obtained  from  healthy </br>donors of a comparable age. This suggests that leukemic cells </br>directly affect NK cell viability and/or activity. This would be </br>achieved through binding HLA-G to the KIR2DL4 ligand, which </br>becomes  expressed  once  NK  cells  are  activated  in  the </br>presence  of  interleukin-2.  Our  working  hypothesis  is  that </br>ectopic  expression  of  HLA-G  contributes  to  block  NK  cell </br>functions.  With  the  aim  of  reproducing  physiological </br>conditions  the  experiments  were  performed  using  whole </br>plasma  instead  of  purified  HLA-G.  The  assumption  was </br>confirmed  by  incubating  NK  cells  obtained  from  normal </br>donors  with  plasma  from  CLL  patients  containing  variable </br></br> </br></br>haematologica | 2014; 129(5) </br></br>897 </br></br> </br></br>\fR .
